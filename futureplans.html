      <h2>Future Plans</h2>
      <p> My future plans are very complex and will probably get blocked by life but, I plan on going to either IUPUI or IU Bloomington
        after High School and double majoring in Computer Science and Business. After that I plan on working in Computer
        Science for a good amount of time and hopefully saving up to begin law school. One of my ambitions is to become an
        immigration lawyer; but, with the surplus of immigration lawyers there are now I would most likely be a business
        lawyer, which is my secondary choice. I plan on using my computer science skills and hopefully my business degree
        to later on open my own law firm and go into private practice as I grow older.</p>
