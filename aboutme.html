      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, again, my name is Flor Mojica. I'm the daughter of two immigrants that migrated
        here in order to give me and my brothers a better life. Although we have struggled a lot throughout the years we
        end up in a pretty good condition. I am bilingual and i'm working on being trilingual. I am fluent in English and
        Spanish and I know a little bit of French. I have two brothers. The youngest is a Freshman at Arsenal Tech High School
        and the oldest one is a Sophomore also at Arsenal Tech. I am the class of 2019 at Arsenal Tech. I will be graduating
        this year with the Academic Honors Diploma. I am very involved at my school and I do many other actvities after school.
        You could basically call me a busybody.</p>
